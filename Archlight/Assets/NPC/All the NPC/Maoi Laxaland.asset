  Dialogs:
  - ' Hello, my name is Maoi. I am the best, and the only blacksmith in town. So if
    you ever need to buy something out of metal just come to me and il see what I
    can do for you. '
  - HOLY MOTHER OF GOD! Is that the Archlight from mount Jarmo you have there in your
    hand! The legend told us about a person who could hold one of the four holy Archlights
    without turning to dust.
  - 'Oh, I see, your new around here, well then I would probably recommend you going
    south, down to the farm. '
  - Grandma Carol is really old and therefore knows her way around here and can probably
    help you scratch up some money for food and tell you more about the story about
    the four Archlights.
  - 'I''m afraid I can''t help you much more because of my business. Hope you get
    more help, See Ya! '
